This is a Hybrid Android app/Web App made with React.js and then converted into Android app using Capcitor/Ionic
[You can find the actual app here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rahulkudum.vaisnava_songs).

## Note

I made this App while learning ReactJs in order to make the learning process intresting and useful and now this app is used by thousands of people with 5 star ratings and now i am very happy as this App is helping many people to enchance their Spirtuality

I used all the important hooks like useState, useEffect, useReducer, useRef, custom hooks and for managing the state of the App instead of using Redux i used React's built Context Api which is pretty cool and ofcourse i used React-Router in this App and coming to the Android stuff although this is hybrid app as I used Capacitor to transform my React web app into android app but it has many native features like downloading the songs and playing the songs from the android device which are made possible by using native capacitor plugins

As i made this app while learing React so i had used many bad practices of writing code in this project but now as i have many other projects and things to do and lear i was unable to correct them so if you are facing any problem while understanding my code please feel free to mail me
